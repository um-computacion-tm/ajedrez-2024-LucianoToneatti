-I also added the function in Board that obtains the movements of the Kings.

# [0.0.5] - 2024-08-18

-Today's new addition was creating and understanding how the diagonal movement of the Alfils could be done and soon I will use the same code for the queen that moves diagonally.
-Also add the function to obtain the Alfils movements.


# [0.0.3] - 2024-08-16

### Added

-This day was very good because I managed to place the pieces I was missing on the board and classify them by color, in addition to testing it.
-Soon I will try to add the movements to the pieces and I will try to optimize the Test that marks the empty boxes.

# [0.0.2] - 2024-08-15

### Added

-Today I only focused on trying to create a function that allows me to make the movements of the rooks and then send the movements of the rooks to the board.

### Added

- In addition to adding everything we saw in class.
